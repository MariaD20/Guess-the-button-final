# Guess-the-button-final

Interactive mini project

In this project I created 3 buttons and, randomly, one of the 3 buttons will be the winning one. 
The player will have to choose/ push one button and a message will be displayed. 
The message will indicate if the pushed button is the winning one or not. 
The player can choose the preferred button more than once.

In this project I used HTML/CSS inspired by Bootstrap and JavaScript.
